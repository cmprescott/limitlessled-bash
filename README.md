command line control over limitlessLED lights

I trolled the internet and only found snippets of stuff for limitless and command line linux,
so I decided to create a shell script myself. Primarily to run off my raspberry pi, but in theory can be used anywhere

I'm lazy, and this is my first commit, so my coding practices/standards are all over the shop. Once the functionality is there I will clean everything up :)
